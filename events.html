    <h2>States' Debate - July 15th</h2>
    <p>
        The States are due to debate the Proposals for a New Discrimination Ordinance on the 15th July 2020. We need as
        many
        people as possible to come along at 8.30am on July 15 to the steps of the Royal Court to show our support for
        the
        proposal to be approved, and demonstrate to the deputies how important it is to protect our people from
        discrimination with a legislation, and to educate the community. Click <a
