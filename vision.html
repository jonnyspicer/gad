<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>
    We are striving to raise awareness of the importance of protecting minority groups from discrimination in the
    Guernsey community.
</p>
<p>
    Our current focus is pushing for the Proposals for a New Discrimination Ordinance to be approved at the Statesâ€™
    debate on the 15th July.
</p>
<p>
    We are pressing for anti-racism education in Guernsey, as well as increased awareness of unconscious bias and
    discrimination in the workplace, in schools and across the community.
</p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>
    We are a campaign group consisting of seven passionate young people from Guernsey, aspiring to change attitudes in
    the community regarding racism and discrimination. We are all either studying or have studied off-island at
    university, and were shocked to learn that Guernsey is the only jurisdiction in Europe (other than Sark and
    Alderney) not to have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, disability, sexual orientation,
    religion and age, in employment, education or provision of goods and services etc.
